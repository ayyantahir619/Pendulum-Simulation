# Pendulum-Simulation
This GitHub repository contains the code for a pendulum simulation using GlowScript 3.0 VPython. The simulation models a simple pendulum consisting of a bob attached to a pivot point by a string. The code calculates and plots the angular position of the pendulum over time.

Features:
>Simulates the motion of a simple pendulum.
>Visualizes the angular position of the pendulum over time.
>Allows customization of initial conditions, such as initial angular velocity.
>Uses the GlowScript 3.0 VPython library for 3D visualization.
